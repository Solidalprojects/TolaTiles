3. API Enhancements
Add these endpoints to your existing API:
/api/product-types/
/api/team/
/api/testimonials/
/api/tiles/?product_type=<id>
4. Admin Dashboard Enhancements
Add these sections to your admin dashboard:

Product Type Management
Team Member Management

Enhanced Analytics

5. Implementation Priorities

Phase 1: Backend models and migrations
Phase 2: API endpoints and serializers
Phase 3: Admin dashboard updates
Phase 4: Frontend page templates
Phase 5: User experience improvements (filtering, search)

6. Database Migration Strategy

Create the new models without breaking changes
Add the product_type field to Tile with null=True
Run migrations
Populate data for new tables
Update existing tiles with appropriate product types

7. Future Considerations

Online Scheduling: Allow customers to book consultations
Product Inventory Management: Track stock levels
Customer Portal: For project tracking and communication
Image Gallery: Enhanced product visualization
Project Calculator: Help customers estimate materials needed
